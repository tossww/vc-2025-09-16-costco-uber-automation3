## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
*What problem are we solving and why does it matter?*

**Example:**
> Email triage takes 2+ hours daily due to lack of automated classification. Users need intelligent filtering that learns from their behavior to surface important messages and defer low-priority items.

### Solution Overview
*High-level approach to solving the problem.*

**Example:**
> Build ML-powered email classifier that analyzes content, sender patterns, and user actions to automatically sort emails into Priority, Review, and Archive buckets with 90%+ accuracy.

### Success Metrics
*How will we measure success?*

**Example:**
- Reduce daily email processing time from 2+ hours to <30 minutes
- Achieve 90%+ classification accuracy after 2 weeks of training
- Process 1000+ emails/day without performance degradation

interface ContentNode {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  contentType: 'note' | 'web_clip' | 'document' | 'image';
  tags: string[];
  links: LinkReference[];
  embeddings: number[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}

interface LinkReference {
  targetId: string;
  linkType: 'mentions' | 'references' | 'similar' | 'custom';
  strength: number; // 0-1 confidence score
  context?: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
*External interfaces and integration points.*

**Example: Study App API**
```typescript
// Core study session management
POST /api/sessions/start
GET /api/sessions/{id}/progress
PUT /api/sessions/{id}/answer
POST /api/sessions/{id}/complete

// Content management
GET /api/content/search?q={query}&type={type}
POST /api/content/create
PUT /api/content/{id}
DELETE /api/content/{id}
```
