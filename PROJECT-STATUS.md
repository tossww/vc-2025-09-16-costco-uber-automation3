## Decisions Needed

### High Priority
1. **Spaced Repetition Algorithm Choice (Study Module)**
   - **Context:** Need to choose between SM-2, FSRS, or custom algorithm
   - **Impact:** Affects all learning functionality and user experience
   - **Deadline:** [Date]
   - **Owner:** Steven Wang
   - **Status:** Research complete, need to make decision

2. **Email Service Integration Approach (Processing Module)**
   - **Context:** Gmail API vs IMAP vs third-party service
   - **Impact:** Determines development complexity and user setup requirements
   - **Deadline:** [Date]
   - **Owner:** Steven Wang
   - **Status:** Need to evaluate options

### Medium Priority
1. **UI Framework Component Library Choice**
   - **Context:** Build custom vs use existing (Chakra UI, Ant Design, etc.)
   - **Impact:** Development speed vs customization flexibility
   - **Deadline:** [Date]
   - **Status:** Leaning toward custom for learning experience

### Low Priority
1. **Deployment Strategy**
   - **Context:** Local-first vs cloud-hosted vs hybrid
   - **Impact:** User experience and maintenance overhead
   - **Status:** Can defer until MVP is functional

## Risk Register

### High Risk 🔴
1. **Scope Creep in Knowledge Module**
   - **Description:** Feature requests expanding beyond core functionality
   - **Probability:** High
   - **Impact:** Delayed completion of other modules
   - **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to PRD and feature prioritization
   - **Owner:** Steven Wang

### Medium Risk 🟡
1. **Performance Issues with Large Content Volumes**
   - **Description:** Search and processing may slow with >10,000 content items
   - **Probability:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Poor user experience, need for architecture changes
   - **Mitigation:** Implement performance testing early, design for scale
   - **Owner:** Steven Wang

2. **Third-party API Rate Limits**
   - **Description:** OpenAI, email services may limit usage
   - **Probability:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Feature limitations or additional costs
   - **Mitigation:** Implement caching, consider local alternatives
   - **Owner:** Steven Wang

### Low Risk 🟢
1. **Technology Learning Curve**
   - **Description:** New technologies may take longer to learn
   - **Probability:** Low (experienced developer)
   - **Impact:** Slightly extended timeline
   - **Mitigation:** Allocate extra time for learning, start simple
   - **Owner:** Steven Wang
