## Decision Log

### ADR-001: Monorepo vs Multi-repo Architecture
**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Steven Wang
**Context:** Need to decide project structure for multiple related applications (second brain, email triage, study app)

#### Problem Statement
How should we structure the codebase to support multiple related projects while maintaining clear boundaries and enabling code reuse?

#### Decision Drivers
- Solo developer with occasional collaboration needs
- Multiple projects with shared utilities and patterns
- History of tech debt from poorly organized code
- Need for clear module boundaries
- Simplified development and deployment workflow

#### Options Considered
1. **Monorepo with Module Boundaries**
   - Pros: Shared tooling, easier refactoring, single clone/setup
   - Cons: Potential for boundary violations, larger repository
   - Trade-offs: Convenience vs. discipline required for boundaries

2. **Multi-repo with Shared Libraries**
   - Pros: Forced separation, independent deployment
   - Cons: Complex dependency management, setup overhead
   - Trade-offs: Clean separation vs. development friction

3. **Single Repository with No Structure**
   - Pros: Simple to start
   - Cons: High risk of spaghetti code, past pain point
   - Trade-offs: Short-term ease vs. long-term maintainability

#### Decision
**Chosen: Monorepo with Module Boundaries**

Rationale: Given the history of tech debt issues and the need for shared code between projects, a monorepo with strictly enforced module boundaries provides the best balance. The shared utilities and patterns across projects (note management, data processing, UI components) benefit from being co-located, while clear architectural boundaries prevent the chaos experienced in previous projects.

#### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Single development environment setup
  - Easy code sharing and refactoring
  - Consistent tooling and standards
  - Atomic commits across related changes
- **Negative:**
  - Requires discipline to maintain boundaries
  - Larger checkout size
  - Potential for accidental coupling
- **Neutral:**
  - All projects in one place (pro for solo dev, potential con for collaboration)

#### Implementation Notes
- Use `/modules/` structure with clear interfaces
- Implement linting rules to prevent cross-module imports
- Create shared module for common utilities
- Document module boundaries in ARCHITECTURE.md

#### Follow-up Actions
- [x] Create module structure as defined in ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Set up ESLint rules for module boundary enforcement
- [ ] Create CI checks for architectural compliance

### ADR-002: TypeScript vs JavaScript for Type Safety
**Date:** 2024-01-16
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Steven Wang
**Context:** Need to choose primary language for development across all modules

#### Problem Statement
Should we use TypeScript or JavaScript for the monorepo, considering type safety, developer experience, and maintenance overhead?

#### Decision Drivers
- History of runtime errors due to type mismatches
- Complex data structures in knowledge management
- Solo development with potential future collaboration
- Need for reliable refactoring capabilities
- Integration with external APIs with complex schemas

#### Options Considered
1. **TypeScript Throughout**
   - Pros: Compile-time error detection, excellent refactoring, self-documenting APIs
   - Cons: Build step complexity, learning curve
   - Trade-offs: Development speed vs. runtime reliability

2. **JavaScript with JSDoc**
   - Pros: No build step, familiar tooling
   - Cons: Weaker type checking, less refactoring support
   - Trade-offs: Simplicity vs. type safety

3. **Mixed Approach (TS for complex modules, JS for simple)**
   - Pros: Flexibility to choose per module
   - Cons: Inconsistent tooling, cognitive overhead
   - Trade-offs: Per-module optimization vs. consistency

#### Decision
**Chosen: TypeScript Throughout**

Given the complexity of data structures (knowledge graphs, email classification, study progress tracking) and the history of type-related bugs, TypeScript provides essential safety. The refactoring benefits are crucial for maintaining clean architecture as the codebase grows.

#### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Catch errors at compile time
  - Excellent IDE support and refactoring
  - Self-documenting APIs and data structures
  - Better collaboration support for future team members
- **Negative:**
  - Build step required
  - Additional tooling complexity
  - Type definition maintenance
- **Neutral:**
  - Slightly slower initial development (offset by fewer bugs)

#### Implementation Notes
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define shared types in `/modules/shared/types/`
- Generate types from database schemas where possible
- Use branded types for domain-specific IDs

#### Follow-up Actions
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration for all modules
- [ ] Create shared type definitions
- [ ] Set up type generation from database schemas

### ADR-003: PostgreSQL vs SQLite for Data Storage
**Date:** 2024-01-17
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Steven Wang
**Context:** Need to choose primary database for content storage, search indices, and user data

#### Problem Statement
What database should we use for storing content, relationships, and user data across all modules?

#### Decision Drivers
- Large volume of content (documents, web clips, notes)
- Complex relationships and graph-like queries
- Full-text search requirements
- Potential for concurrent access in future
- Local-first development with cloud deployment option

#### Options Considered
1. **PostgreSQL**
   - Pros: Full-text search, JSONB, excellent performance, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Deployment complexity, overkill for simple cases
   - Trade-offs: Power and features vs. simplicity

2. **SQLite**
   - Pros: Zero-config, embedded, perfect for local development
   - Cons: Limited concurrent access, weaker full-text search
   - Trade-offs: Simplicity vs. scalability

3. **Mixed Approach (SQLite dev, PostgreSQL production)**
   - Pros: Easy development, powerful production
   - Cons: Development/production parity issues
   - Trade-offs: Dev convenience vs. potential compatibility issues

#### Decision
**Chosen: PostgreSQL**

The full-text search capabilities, JSONB support for flexible schemas, and excellent performance with complex queries make PostgreSQL ideal for knowledge management and content processing. The overhead is acceptable given the complexity of the intended use cases.

#### Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Excellent full-text search with ranking
