- **Customizable Checks:** Pre-commit checks can be extended
- **Tool Agnostic:** Works with various programming languages and tools
- **Fallback Compatibility:** Works even without optional dependencies

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Run `init-project.sh` to create project structure
2. Customize core documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)
3. Set up development environment and tools

### Phase 2: Feature Development
1. Start feature with `new-feature.sh feature-name`
2. Complete the generated PRD with requirements
3. Make architectural decisions and update ADR
4. Implement feature following test-driven development
5. Run `pre-commit-checks.sh` before committing

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. Automated checks validate code quality
2. Tests ensure functionality works correctly
